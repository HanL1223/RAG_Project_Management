* Create data share between Sigma & CW SF
* Create a dedicated warehouse for Rachel’s team on CW SF
* Her warehouse can only access the 5 x agreed Sigma datasets
* Everything will be automated (CI/CD) – means alignment to security and quick turnaround for future data sharing requests from any team

 

*Cost:*

* For Rachel’s warehouse, start with extra small, apply a cap amount of our choosing
* If above doesn’t suffice then we would dial up accordingly

 

*Timelines:*

* Est delivery date is +*26*++^*th*^+ +*Feb*+ (we aim to finish by +*18*++^*th*^+ +*Feb*++)+
* Detailed plan below (basically 3 x weeks effort between Jag & Harry)

Overview

The existing Appriss Datashare ELT query requires refinement to improve accuracy, maintainability, and alignment with the current data product standards. This work ensures the ELT logic is consistent with the latest Appriss data-share requirements, resolves gaps identified during QA, and prepares the pipeline for downstream reporting dependencies.

h2. Steps

# Review the current Appriss Datashare ELT SQL and document all existing joins, filters, transformations, and business rules.
# Identify inconsistencies, redundant logic, missing filters, or misaligned business definitions based on updated Appriss documentation and stakeholder feedback.
# Update and refine the SQL ELT logic to reflect the correct business rules, ensuring alignment with Bronze → Silver conventions and naming standards.
# Validate refined output against expected Appriss samples (e.g., benchmark extracts, QA logs, historical outputs).
# Optimise query performance where appropriate (index use, partition pruning, CTE structure, join ordering).
# Peer review with Data Engineering and validate with Appriss SME before promoting the updated query.
# Update documentation, lineage, and add comments within the SQL code for ongoing maintainability.

h2. Deliverables

* Refined and validated Appriss Datashare ELT SQL query.
* Comparison document outlining logic changes vs previous version.
* Updated data lineage / documentation in Confluence & Alation.
* Peer-review sign-off and test results.

h2. Acceptance Criteria

* All business rules in the refined ELT logic align with current Appriss data share specifications.
* Output datasets match expected Appriss benchmarks with no material discrepancies.
* SQL code passes peer review and conforms to internal coding standards.
* Performance is equal to or better than the existing ELT job.
* Documentation and lineage links are updated and published.",,Han Li,,,,,,712020:690de3f9-4a74-4bd2-b5bf-495f7e62ea96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Given, When, Then",,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@13e4324d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i0129d:,,,,,,,,,,,,Supply Chain Sprint 14,,,,,,,,10/Dec/25 12:00 AM,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10318_*:*_1_*:*_172724756_*|*_10317_*:*_1_*:*_598_*|*_10351_*:*_1_*:*_0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Done,18/Dec/25 11:14 AM

h3. *Context*

Users are intermittently unable to see application content in Cognos. IBM’s initial investigation indicates a correlation with JVM memory pressure; JVM size has been increased as recommended.
Further internal analysis shows the issue occurs mainly on Mondays and Tuesdays and coincides with heavy execution of the _Buyer Category Performance Drill-Through Report_, which queries large-volume data across multiple tables.
This report appears to be a significant contributor to JVM load and may be impacting overall Cognos stability.

----

h3. *Acceptance Criteria*

* Performance investigation completed within  estimation.
* Root cause confirmed and documented with evidence (logs, query analysis, JVM metrics).
* Proposed optimisation approach reduces report execution time and/or JVM load.

* ALTIDA has its own Git repo containing all ALTIDA code, config, IaC and pipeline definitions.
* No ALTIDA code/config/IaC lives in any core platform or shared infrastructure repo. Other repos can reference ALTIDA only via documented loosely coupled integration points (eg. queues, file locations, APIs).
* Disabling ALTIDA pipelines and archiving the ALTIDA repo does not require code changes in other repos beyond removing those integration references.

*IaC and no Click-Ops:*

* All Snowflake and cloud resources required by ALTIDA are defined and managed only via IaC in ALTIDA repo (no portal or Snowflake UI changes).
* A new environment (eg. DEV/SIT/UAT) can be provisioned from empty to full working ALTIDA by running the documented CI/CD pipeline, with no manual steps.

*CI/CD Configuration:*

* ALTIDA has dedicated CI/CD pipelines in its repo for build, test/validation and deploy to each environment.
* Environment differences are handled via parameters and secrets (eg. Key Vault) not by branching code or hand-editing config in the UI.

*Security & Access:*

* ALTIDA uses its own service accounts and roles (Snowflake, cloud) defined in IaC with least privilege, limited to the layers/resources it needs (Landing/Bronze) and not to curated/core platform components
* No shared “god” roles or service accounts exists between ALTIDA and other platform components. Secrets are stored only in approved secret stores, not in code or pipeline definitions.

*Replaceability/Decommissioning:*

* The ALTIDA repo includes a short, tested decommission procedure describing how to disable ALTIDA, remove its resources and revoke its identities without impacting the rest of the platform.
* There are no hard dependencies on ALTIDA internals in other repos (no imports of ALTIDA libraries or assumptions about ALTIDA-specific structures). Integration contracts are documented so a future replacement data ingestion solution can plug into the same interfaces.",,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@359d0187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i00z9u:z,,,,,,,,,,,,Supply Chain Sprint 13,,,,,,,,10/Nov/25 12:00 AM,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-11-10 01:58:38.727,10318_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10317_*:*_1_*:*_1306607717,10/Nov/25 12:58 PM;639b6a55914b350865d28d1b;Hi [~accountid:712020:26bbf657-6ab9-41a2-bde7-06a7c3c472f2] please add the Acceptance Criteria when you are ready.,"24/Nov/25 2:24 PM;639b6a55914b350865d28d1b;[~accountid:557058:ee707013-ba36-4df4-9ee3-43a3a2b3fb84] can you please rename the edp-snowflake repo to edp-etl-atilda-legacy.

Query build is complete based on my understanding and documentation available. I have got  few question for Business Team/APPRISS

 

# Amount : if electronic payment exists then electronic payment else sum of other payments
# Type: One invoice will have only one type : direction order will be as below

CASH, CREDIT, CHEQUE, ACCOUNT

# Card Expiry is defaulted to 12/99 . Is that correct? We don’t have card expiry date captured anyway.
# Cash back is mapped to Cashout Amount . Is it correct? What is the definition?
# Authorization code  is not correctly mapped Electronic Ref is hashed card key. It should be mapped to Approved code. changed in my query
# Tender data will be null for any payment other that electronic payment.
# Gift Balance is always null. It should be mapped with Gift Balance in Tender Data. Changed accordingly.
# 'card_number' hard coded as 'TOKENIZED' , it should be electronicref which is hashed Key of actual card number. Changed accordingly.
# Bin Number was wrongly mapped . Now it is mapped to Leading 9 characters of the hashed Card number
# electronic_receipt is mapped blank . It should be the actual electronic receipt? Mapped to Electronic receipt. Please let me know in case it needs to be blank

# Order id  & ID  Same mapping. They both mapped to Invoice Id Is this expected?
# Definition of Department: Is it Product Group? Product Category is highest level, Product Group is one level down
# TRANSACTION_CLASS : Need definition , did not have any info in document
# Supplier ID  : Should it not be Manufacturer/ Main Supplier . Supplier ID is internal to CWH and checked that we are not sharing any supplier name in any file. So supplier ID might not be of any use
# We found some differences between APRISS Document and APPRISS Schema which was actually shared with APPRISS team. As per discussion with James, we are taking APPRISS Schema as bible and creating data points based on that.

*Steps*

# Confirm with stakeholders whether the total amount should always equal the sum of all line items (excluding rounding tolerances) in the secure database schema.
# Data Engineering team to validate if the discrepancy originates from:
#* Source system calculation or rounding logic, or
#* ETL transformation or aggregation logic in the current data pipeline.
# Identify all affected invoices exhibiting similar discrepancies.",,Amitabha Chakraborty,Han Li,,,,,712020:336e9d5e-75da-4154-8ff5-aa4e54f44381,712020:690de3f9-4a74-4bd2-b5bf-495f7e62ea96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"*Acceptance Criteria*

* *Root Cause Identified:* Source of the discrepancy (source system vs ETL logic) is clearly documented.
* *Fix Implemented:* Data logic corrected and validated so that header totals reconcile with summed line items (within accepted rounding limits).
* *Validation Passed:* QA confirms that post-fix, total header and item-level values are consistent across test invoices.",,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@579c0f4c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i0110k:zzzzwzw,,,,,,,,,,,,Supply Chain Sprint 12,,,,,,,,27/Oct/25 12:00 AM,,0.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-11-18 02:32:20.486,10318_*:*_1_*:*_688495916_*|*_10317_*:*_1_*:*_441873396_*|*_10351_*:*_1_*:*_0,"18/Nov/25 1:32 PM;712020:336e9d5e-75da-4154-8ff5-aa4e54f44381;

AC Nov 4: CW to investigate

AC Nov 18: Total value received by staff from Customer : $100

Mode of Payment: Cash

Line Item Total: $15.98

Rounding: $.02

Total Line Item: $16

Change given to Customer: $84

Invoice Header Amount value and Invoice Line item amount sum may differ whenever there is a cash payment involved. In this invoice:35358912688554000 if someone pays cash as payment and gives $100 to the cashier for products worth $16. Then the Total Amount from the product line item would be $16, and Header Invoice would be $100. It does not take the change returned ($84 ) into account.

Context

* We need a simple, durable Git repo naming standard for the Enterprise Data Platform (EDP) that works across clouds/regions without future renames. Use lowercase *kebab-case* and avoid embedding env/region/provider in names.

h3. Objective

* Adopt a task-oriented pattern and pair it with CI/CD parameters for multi-cloud/region deployments.
*Naming pattern:* {{edp-<capability>-<task>[-<asset>]}}
Examples: {{edp-infra-provision}}, {{edp-ingest-orchestrate-pipelines}}, {{edp-transform-build-warehouse}}, {{edp-model-publish-semantic}}, {{edp-visualize-publish-dashboards}}. (Lowercase, hyphens only.)

h3. Steps 

# 
# Publish standard and examples in Confluence; notify teams.
# Rename existing repos to the new pattern (no env/region/provider in slug). 
# Update pipelines to use a *matrix* for cloud/region (e.g., {{CLOUD=az|aws}}, {{REGION=au-ae|eu}}).
# Configure Terraform state backends per cloud/region: *azurerm* on Azure, *s3* on AWS. 
# (If using ADF) Deploy from *publish* artifacts/ARM templates, not raw JSON.

h3. Deliverables

* Documented naming standard with examples.
* Renamed repos aligned to {{edp-<capability>-<task>[-<asset>]}}.
* CI/CD updated to matrix by cloud/region; TF backends isolated per target; ADF using publish flow.

Query build is complete based on my understanding and documentation available. I have got  few question for Business Team/APPRISS

 

# Order id  & order Number Same mapping. They both mapped to Invoice Id Is this expected?
# Definition of Total Amount :  Invoice Header Amount value and Invoice Line item amount sum may differ whenever there is a cash payment involved. An example would give you a better understanding. ( Invoice ID : 801125062148140) If someone pays cash as payment and gives $50 to cashier  for product worth $34.50 . Then Total Amount from product line item would be 34.50 and Header Invoice would be $50. It does not take change returned ($15.50 ) into account. Which field is expected? Please confirm from APPRISS
# Total Amount, Calculated Total, Original Total : They all have same mapping . Is there any definition shared by APPRISS team for the same?
# We found some differences between APRISS Document and APPRISS Schema which was actually shared with APPRISS team. As per discussion with James, we are taking APPRISS Schema as bible and creating data points based on that.

# Raise firewall request via ServiceNow (be sure to use the correct ticket type, otherwise it will get rejected) - [https://cwretail.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4e233585db8f8050633287f43a961929|https://cwretail.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4e233585db8f8050633287f43a961929|smart-link] 
## If unsure how to complete the request, copy ticket *RITM0177824*
## Specify all details in the ticket request, including the server IP address to whitelist (on-prem SQL server IP) and our SHIR IP (*172.29.84.64/27 (SHIR - cwr-ase-edp-shir-dev-vmss)*)
# After ticket is raised it will go to the *Security* team - they will ask us lots of questions about what we’re trying to do (even though it is specified within the ticket)
# After Security approve the ticket, it will go to the *Network* team automatically
## Note: we need to ask the Service Desk team to create an additional task assigned to this ticket to the *Cloud* team - in the current Firewall ServiceNow ticketing flow, this does not get automatically created. We can only do this *after* Security have approved the ticket (see *RITM0177824* as an example)
# For the whitelisting to be fully completed, both the network and cloud team need to complete their tasks
# Once we receive confirmation that firewall listing has been done on both sides, we can test this connection in ADF
## Note: to do this we need a service account create that can login onto PDB14, however note this has already been done and credentials are stored in the Key Vault

*Problem Statement*

Our Snowflake Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) setup, deployed via Azure DevOps, uses a service role ROLE_INFRA_ADMIN_SNOWFLAKE to create and manage objects (databases, schemas, RBAC grants) across environments: *DEV, SIT, UAT, PROD*.

However, there’s a challenge:

* Future grants on schemas and objects require either *MANAGE GRANTS* (a high-privilege, organisation-wide permission) or *schema ownership*.
* Granting *MANAGE GRANTS* to the IaC role violates least-privilege principles.
* We need a *fully automated IaC solution* with no manual steps, while maintaining strong access control.

 

*Proposed Solution: Managed Access Schema + Role Ownership Pattern*

* Use *Managed Access Schemas (MAS)* in all environments for consistent IaC behaviour and centralised grant control.
* *Design Summary*:
** Each schema is created as a Managed Access Schema, e.g.
CREATE SCHEMA EDP_${ENV}.SILVER WITH MANAGED ACCESS;
** Schema ownership is assigned to a dedicated role, e.g.
OPS_${ENV}
** The IaC service role (ROLE_INFRA_ADMIN_SNOWFLAKE) performs grants and object creation on behalf of the schema-owner role (via USE ROLE or delegated ownership).
** Developers in *DEV* can assume the schema-owner role for flexibility.
** In *SIT/UAT/PROD*, only the IaC pipeline holds this privilege — ensuring RBAC consistency, least privilege, and full automation.

 

*Benefits*

|*Area*|*Outcome*|
|*Security*|No need for MANAGE GRANTS; privileges limited to schema level.|
|*Consistency*|Identical IaC templates across all environments.|
|*Governance*|Centralised privilege control via schema-owner roles.|
|*Automation*|All schema creation and grants handled by IaC pipeline, zero manual steps.|
|*Flexibility*|Developers retain freedom in DEV through delegated roles.|

*In short:*
Standardise on Managed Access Schemas across environments and assign schema ownership to environment-specific roles. The IaC role manages objects and future grants under these roles — delivering *full automation*, *least privilege*, and *end-to-end consistency*.","25/Nov/25 10:53 AM;639b6a55914b350865d28d1b;{noformat}-- 1.

Implement Azure DNS Private Resolver to enable on-premises DNS resolution for existing Snowflake Private Link endpoint ([privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com|http://privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com]).

The Azure Private Link for Snowflake is already configured and operational. This DNS implementation will enable on-premises systems to resolve the private Snowflake endpoint, which is a prerequisite for subsequent firewall access configuration for Enterprise Data Platform and critical applications requiring Snowflake access.

Spoke to Network team and they suggested we create AD security group for snowflake private link access control and add the relevant users who need access to this group as the user laptop ip address is dynamic so this way we can control this via global protect and firewall.

* Connect dbt Cloud to our Snowflake instance on Azure to enable secure, version-controlled data transformations, scheduled jobs, and CI for analytics. The setup will use least-privilege access, correct Azure region selection, and standardized dev/staging/prod environments.

h3. Objective

* Provision Snowflake user/role with least-privilege and a dedicated warehouse.
* Configure dbt Cloud connection: account identifier, Azure region, user/role, warehouse, database, schema; select approved auth (key pair or OAuth/SSO).
* Store credentials in dbt Cloud environment variables; avoid hardcoded secrets.
* Set up dev and deployment environments/jobs; map targets to separate schemas.
* Validate with dbt debug and a sample dbt run; confirm role, warehouse, and permissions.
* Document egress IPs (for allowlisting/PrivateLink), connection details, and handoff steps.

Yes currently the PBI user is connecting with the privatelink ([cw-au.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com|http://cw-au.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com]). See below details of the current setup:

!image-20251110-054022.png|width=437,alt=""image-20251110-054022.png""!

We are connecting via the *EDP_ANALYSIS_DEV* warehouse, and using the *S_POWERBI_DEV* user account (basic authentication).

The current VNet Gateway we are connecting with is *cwr-ase-edp-dev-vdgw*:

!image-20251110-054149.png|width=742,alt=""image-20251110-054149.png""!

The virtual network this sits on is *cwr-ase-nonprod-dpdev-vnet*:

!image-20251110-054237.png|width=700,alt=""image-20251110-054237.png""!

And the IP Address under the Subnet for Fabric is *172.29.84.96/27*.",11/Nov/25 9:25 AM;639b6a55914b350865d28d1b;As confirmed by Eugene the IP range below is fixed for Vnet Data Gateway in Dev environment.

Once we enable the PrivateLink-only mode via the below scripts:

{noformat}SELECT SYSTEM$ENFORCE_PRIVATELINK_ACCESS_ONLY();{noformat}

Snowflake enforces:

* All traffic must come through Azure PrivateLink
* Public endpoint → fully blocked
* TLS termination happens only on the PrivateLink endpoint
* Source traffic will always appear as your private VNet IPs (10.x.x.x)

This alone gives you a network boundary.

So even without any Snowflake Network Policy:       

* Public access is impossible
* Internet access is impossible
* Malicious external traffic cannot reach your account
* Only PrivateLink-connected Azure VNets can reach Snowflake

This is for Snowflake to access Manhattan Active. They have already been able to action the whitelisting on their end, but we need to enable whitelisting on our firewall also.
We will be querying their database and ingesting into Snowflake via ADF (same pattern as our network drive). Manhattan won't be accessing anything our end - we just need to enable our firewall so that we can query their DB

h3. More Details:

# Port is 3306 (default) 
# We are wanting to enable the firewall rule for Azure (so our SHIR - which is hosted in Azure can access Manhattan)
# The data flow is: Manhattan Active --> SHIR + ADF --> Blob Storage --> Snowflake
#* We use ADF as the ETL tool to move data from Manhattan to Blob Storage, and the SHIR is the machine which powers this
# The requirement is to have the ability to move data *from Manhattan* *to our Azure* Environment - that's what we need enabled
#* From here, we then use ADF + SHIR to move the data to Snowflake
# SHIR is on an Azure VM Scale Set - cwr-ase-edp-shir-dev-vmss. It is all in the cloud and is sitting in our private network
# Warehouse Management/Stock Data - no PII

This is for Snowflake to access Manhattan Active. They have already been able to action the whitelisting on their end, but we need to enable whitelisting on our firewall also.
We will be querying their database and ingesting into Snowflake via ADF (same pattern as our network drive). Manhattan won't be accessing anything our end - we just need to enable our firewall so that we can query their DB

Your understanding is correct. This is to do initial review and start putting initial questions. No build work at the moment. At the moment Amit has provided the mapping sheet for facts ( Fact Sales, electronic payments etc) but not the dimensions yet. Also, he is yet to provide APPRISS data model for us to get started.

The historic data ingestion for below 2 tables are done through parquet files. However, There is an ongoing issue with ingestion framework where some of the columns getting missed if they contain null in first row. So, at the moment we have added the missing columns manually. Hence there is a need to test these columns getting populated properly when we manually add these in snowflake  tables and views.

I have received the additional table names from stockDb for ingestion from Amit. However, he advised us to double verify the server details with Bhavya/Adeel.

Currently we are ingesting the stock DB data from following server. Amit asked us to verify if this is the right server as he he is not very sure if this is the right one or not. FYI, the below one was identified much earlier (Adeel is aware of). Please double confirm this information.

#* ExpressRoute connection metrics (e.g., Ingress/Egress throughput) are visible in Azure Monitor or Network Insights.
#* Bandwidth usage can be correlated with ADF pipeline execution timelines.
# *Alerting Rules:*
#* Alerts are configured to trigger when bandwidth usage exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 70% of provisioned bandwidth).
#* Alerts include pipeline metadata (e.g., pipeline name, run ID) when possible, to trace high-usage executions.
# *Log Collection:*
#* Network bandwidth logs (e.g., from Network Performance Monitor or Azure Network Watcher) are retained for a minimum of 30 days.
#* ADF pipeline run logs include integration runtime IPs or endpoints for cross-reference.
# *Validation Testing:*
#* At least one high-throughput ADF pipeline is executed to validate that bandwidth spikes are captured and logged as expected.
#* Test scenarios simulate concurrent pipeline runs to verify system responsiveness and alert thresholds.
# *Governance & Review:*
#* A monthly review is conducted to assess if bandwidth consumption patterns require scaling up/down of ExpressRoute or ADF optimization.

#* ExpressRoute connection metrics (e.g., Ingress/Egress throughput) are visible in Azure Monitor or Network Insights.
#* Bandwidth usage can be correlated with ADF pipeline execution timelines.
# *Alerting Rules:*
#* Alerts are configured to trigger when bandwidth usage exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 70% of provisioned bandwidth).
#* Alerts include pipeline metadata (e.g., pipeline name, run ID) when possible, to trace high-usage executions.
# *Log Collection:*
#* Network bandwidth logs (e.g., from Network Performance Monitor or Azure Network Watcher) are retained for a minimum of 30 days.
#* ADF pipeline run logs include integration runtime IPs or endpoints for cross-reference.
# *Validation Testing:*
#* At least one high-throughput ADF pipeline is executed to validate that bandwidth spikes are captured and logged as expected.
#* Test scenarios simulate concurrent pipeline runs to verify system responsiveness and alert thresholds.
# *Governance & Review:*
#* A monthly review is conducted to assess if bandwidth consumption patterns require scaling up/down of ExpressRoute or ADF optimization.

Implement Azure DNS Private Resolver to enable on-premises DNS resolution for existing Snowflake Private Link endpoint ([privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com|http://privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com]).

The Azure Private Link for Snowflake is already configured and operational. This DNS implementation will enable on-premises systems to resolve the private Snowflake endpoint, which is a prerequisite for subsequent firewall access configuration for Enterprise Data Platform and critical applications requiring Snowflake access.

Spoke to Network team and they suggested we create AD security group for snowflake private link access control and add the relevant users who need access to this group as the user laptop ip address is dynamic so this way we can control this via global protect and firewall.

ETL Logic onPrem. 

Step 1: 

Insert into Staging : 

{noformat}select rn=row_number() over (partition by DateStampDayOnly, MyCHemID, OriginBranchID order by DateStamp desc, RecordID desc)
		,*
		,1 as isPlaceholder
		from Fact_Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
		where DateStamp >= ""PreviousDate"" and DateStamp < ""CurrentDate""
	) dt2
	where rn = 1 {noformat}

Insert into the new data from source which is only housing data changes 

{noformat}insert Into Staging  
select 
	RecordID, MychemID, AvgRealCost, SOH, DateStamp
	, coalesce(ChangeType, 26) as ChangeType		-- set null ChangeType to SOH Import
	, coalesce(SOHChange, 0) as SOHChange
	, StaffID, RealCost, ExpectedSales, OriginBranchID, DateStampDayOnly
	, 0 as SOH_Last
	, 0 as ExpectedSales_Last
	, 0 as LineNumber
	, DateStamp as DateStampOriginal
	, 0 as isPlaceholder
	, hasExcessiveValue
from 
	Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
where 
	DateStamp >= ""currentDate"" and 
	DateStamp < ""nextDate"" and
	RecordID > ""maxRecordID"" {noformat}

Then It Self joins and deletes all records where isPlaceholder = 1 and has a record in the second join where the isPlaceholder = 0

{noformat}delete Staging  
from
(
	select nr.OriginBranchID, nr.MyCHemID
	from Staging  nr
	where 
		nr.isPlaceholder = 0
		and nr.DateStamp >= @currentDate
		and nr.DateStamp < @nextDate 

) dt
where 
	Staging.isPlaceholder = 1
	and Staging.DateStamp >= ""currentDate""
	and Staging.DateStamp < ""nextDate""
	and Staging.OriginBranchID = dt.OriginBranchID
	and Staging.MychemID = dt.MychemID{noformat}

this ensures that we will have one record for every ChemID , for every Store fore everyday. 

The ETL for this table must be really thought through as it can get quite resource hungry.

Harrison had entered a few more fields. SAFETYSTOCKQTY, DamagedQty,  UnsellableQty and ExpiredQty.

I have done some research to to be able to get these information out of the ERP system. 
expired qty can possibly be found from INVENTBATCH  table but when i checked the table it doesn't contain any useful information.

Below 2 tables have got 15 days of history and not beyond that as data gets archived to other tables. 

|TDB15|ILS|Shipment_detail|
|TDB15|ILS|Shipment_header|

Do we need to consider the other 2 tables  for ingestion where data gets archived from above tables? If yes, I am happy to consider in our next sprint. Currently these are not listed in our spreadsheet for ingestion.

There is no straight forward delete as this table does not have any unique column to identify the delete and snowflake does not support rownum, cte and qualify for deleting duplicates without unique column.  Used the below workaround to achieve this.

Actions Taken: -

* Created CUSTINVOICETRANS_DuplicatesRemoved with distinct records.
* Renamed CUSTINVOICETRANS to CUSTINVOICETRANS_Backup.
* Renamed the new table to CUSTINVOICETRANS.

ETL Logic onPrem. 

Step 1: 

Insert into Staging : 

{noformat}select rn=row_number() over (partition by DateStampDayOnly, MyCHemID, OriginBranchID order by DateStamp desc, RecordID desc)
		,*
		,1 as isPlaceholder
		from Fact_Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
		where DateStamp >= ""PreviousDate"" and DateStamp < ""CurrentDate""
	) dt2
	where rn = 1 {noformat}

Insert into the new data from source which is only housing data changes 

{noformat}insert Into Staging  
select 
	RecordID, MychemID, AvgRealCost, SOH, DateStamp
	, coalesce(ChangeType, 26) as ChangeType		-- set null ChangeType to SOH Import
	, coalesce(SOHChange, 0) as SOHChange
	, StaffID, RealCost, ExpectedSales, OriginBranchID, DateStampDayOnly
	, 0 as SOH_Last
	, 0 as ExpectedSales_Last
	, 0 as LineNumber
	, DateStamp as DateStampOriginal
	, 0 as isPlaceholder
	, hasExcessiveValue
from 
	Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
where 
	DateStamp >= ""currentDate"" and 
	DateStamp < ""nextDate"" and
	RecordID > ""maxRecordID"" {noformat}

Then It Self joins and deletes all records where isPlaceholder = 1 and has a record in the second join where the isPlaceholder = 0

{noformat}delete Staging  
from
(
	select nr.OriginBranchID, nr.MyCHemID
	from Staging  nr
	where 
		nr.isPlaceholder = 0
		and nr.DateStamp >= @currentDate
		and nr.DateStamp < @nextDate 

) dt
where 
	Staging.isPlaceholder = 1
	and Staging.DateStamp >= ""currentDate""
	and Staging.DateStamp < ""nextDate""
	and Staging.OriginBranchID = dt.OriginBranchID
	and Staging.MychemID = dt.MychemID{noformat}

this ensures that we will have one record for every ChemID , for every Store fore everyday. 

The ETL for this table must be really thought through as it can get quite resource hungry. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51923,CSCI-224,Source-to-Target Mapping,Done,15/Aug/25 4:38 PM

* Product
* DC/Warehouse/Plant
* Store

{quote}Following a review of the on-prem DEV and PROD environments for key databases (StockDB, SCAX2012, ILS, TransactionStorage), discrepancies were identified in schema alignment and data volume. Adeel Syed provided a detailed comparison, highlighting schema mismatches in StockDB and data size differences in TransactionStorage and ILS.

Notably, SCAX2012 was recently refreshed and is up-to-date.

[~accountid:639b6a55914b350865d28d1b] has proposed a prioritised refresh plan to align DEV with PROD, particularly to support accurate modelling and pipeline validation in Snowflake environments.

Rachel Wan confirmed that DEV environments are refreshed only upon request and are not automatically synced with PROD.

*Summary of Findings:*

* *SCAX2012*: Recently refreshed (11 July 2025) – no further action required.
* *StockDB*: Schema drift identified across 7 tables (refer to _SchemaCompare.docx_) – refresh required to align DEV with PROD.
* *TransactionStorage*: DEV has more records than PROD due to regular archiving in PROD (not duplication). Tables archived include:
** {{BranchOrderItems}}, {{BranchOrders}}, {{Store_IncrementalSOHChanges}}, {{Transactions}}, {{Transactions_Invoice}}
** {{Shipment_detail}}, {{Shipment_header}}
* *ILS*: Data size gaps observed – refresh recommended but not urgent.

*Proposed Refresh Priority:*

# *StockDB* – to resolve schema mismatches.
# *TransactionStorage* – to align data volume and ensure DEV reflects current PROD state.
# *ILS* – to be scheduled after the above.{quote}",,Phillip Yuen,,,,,,712020:8873ba74-1290-47cf-a8f7-d0188433dc67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CSCI-185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"*StockDB refresh*

#* ExpressRoute connection metrics (e.g., Ingress/Egress throughput) are visible in Azure Monitor or Network Insights.
#* Bandwidth usage can be correlated with ADF pipeline execution timelines.
# *Alerting Rules:*
#* Alerts are configured to trigger when bandwidth usage exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 70% of provisioned bandwidth).
#* Alerts include pipeline metadata (e.g., pipeline name, run ID) when possible, to trace high-usage executions.
# *Log Collection:*
#* Network bandwidth logs (e.g., from Network Performance Monitor or Azure Network Watcher) are retained for a minimum of 30 days.
#* ADF pipeline run logs include integration runtime IPs or endpoints for cross-reference.
# *Validation Testing:*
#* At least one high-throughput ADF pipeline is executed to validate that bandwidth spikes are captured and logged as expected.
#* Test scenarios simulate concurrent pipeline runs to verify system responsiveness and alert thresholds.
# *Governance & Review:*
#* A monthly review is conducted to assess if bandwidth consumption patterns require scaling up/down of ExpressRoute or ADF optimization.

How to Authenticate

Developers will start in PBI Desktop/Tabular Editor. To begin development, the user will select the Snowflake connector type and enter in their credentials:

* Server: cw-au.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
* Warehouse: <spoke’s dedicated PBI warehouse>
* Login details: SSO with AAD

From here a developer can select the table/s they wish to pull from Snowflake. As they’ve signed in as themselves they will view all tables that they have access to in Snowflake.

Once selected, the developer will choose ‘import mode’ for their data (we will discourage the use of DirectQuery).

From here they will develop and build their dashboard. Once completed they will publish to their Workspace in PBI Service.



Once published, the user will go to their semantic model settings. They will need to navigate to ‘Gateway and cloud connections’, select +On+ for ‘Use an On-premises or VNet data gateway’. Locate to the VNet gateway and map the Snowflake data source to their relevant connection name (their connection will be to a Service Account, based on the spoke’s dedicated warehouse and roles granted). After selected, hit ‘apply’ and the semantic model is ready to be deployed and refreshed.","04/Aug/25 5:31 PM;712020:2ff24ce0-2b56-4a71-9d7f-e5cc95f2ccd0;h2. What developers need access to

* Snowflake login (setup with AAD SSO)
* Their spoke’s environment in SF

*** The roles grant access to the relevant DB’s/schema’s/table’s in SF
*** Each role will have a warehouse where users can query SF for analytics and sourcing data

h3. Power BI

* Power BI Desktop
* Tabular Editor Pro (if applicable for super users)

Hi Eugene 🙂 

FYI been testing connecting PBI to Snowflake today, so far so good with everything regarding the VNet gateway you configured 🙂 Thanks for all your help.

One thing I noticed is within PBI Desktop, I can’t seem to connect to our Snowflake server with the privatelink URL (cw-au.*privatelink*.snowflakecomputing.com). I have no issues in PBI Service.

Are you able to enable the use of the privatelink in the PBI Desktop app? Would we need to be able to do the same in tabular editor also?

Let me know, thanks! 🙂 ","04/Aug/25 4:47 PM;712020:2ff24ce0-2b56-4a71-9d7f-e5cc95f2ccd0;!image-20250804-064728.png|width=1044,height=57,alt=""image-20250804-064728.png""!",05/Aug/25 12:44 AM;557058:ee707013-ba36-4df4-9ee3-43a3a2b3fb84;[~accountid:712020:2ff24ce0-2b56-4a71-9d7f-e5cc95f2ccd0] are you connecting directly from PowerBI?

For the Azure VM’s as a backup - can you clarify in what kind of scenarios this would be required? How would this differ to using jumpbox?

Also for the non-CW domain users (eg: Harrison and Phillip) - in this architecture can they access CW data? Do they have access to using jumpbox etc? Maybe something else to consider 🙂 

Cheers","05/Aug/25 12:53 AM;557058:ee707013-ba36-4df4-9ee3-43a3a2b3fb84;[~accountid:712020:2ff24ce0-2b56-4a71-9d7f-e5cc95f2ccd0] the Azure VM is going to be used as a fallback when all the other options are not accessible, e.g. ExpressRoute is down, VPN Access not available, Jumpboxes not available.

For non-CW domain users, they may need CW accounts if there is not account federation yet.

Adeel Syed provided a detailed comparison, highlighting schema mismatches in StockDB and data size differences in TransactionStorage and ILS. 

Notably, SCAX2012 was recently refreshed and is up-to-date.

[~accountid:639b6a55914b350865d28d1b] has proposed a prioritised refresh plan to align DEV with PROD, particularly to support accurate modelling and pipeline validation in Snowflake environments. 

Rachel Wan confirmed that DEV environments are refreshed only upon request and are not automatically synced with PROD.



*Summary of Findings:*

* *SCAX2012*: Recently refreshed (11 July 2025) – no further action required.
* *StockDB*: Schema drift identified across 7 tables (refer to _SchemaCompare.docx_) – refresh required to align DEV with PROD.
* *TransactionStorage*: DEV has more records than PROD due to regular archiving in PROD (not duplication). Tables archived include:
** {{BranchOrderItems}}, {{BranchOrders}}, {{Store_IncrementalSOHChanges}}, {{Transactions}}, {{Transactions_Invoice}}
** {{Shipment_detail}}, {{Shipment_header}}
* *ILS*: Data size gaps observed – refresh recommended but not urgent.

*Proposed Refresh Priority:*

# *StockDB* – to resolve schema mismatches.
# *TransactionStorage* – to align data volume and ensure DEV reflects current PROD state.
# *ILS* – to be scheduled after the above.

@Rachel Wan – to advise on the formal process for requesting refreshes for these databases. 
Once confirmed, requests to be raised.",,Chloe Tran,Harrison Wilson,Phillip Yuen,,,,639b6a55914b350865d28d1b,611df863aee32f006fa8d8ff,712020:8873ba74-1290-47cf-a8f7-d0188433dc67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CSCI-186,CSCI-223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

Harrison had entered a few more fields. SAFETYSTOCKQTY, DamagedQty,  UnsellableQty and ExpiredQty.

I have done some research to to be able to get these information out of the ERP system. 
expired qty can possibly be found from INVENTBATCH  table but when i checked the table it doesn't contain any useful information.

Have started a conversation with CWR AX Consultants and jess to see if can get this data out. 

[~accountid:611df863aee32f006fa8d8ff] , we might want to think about this table. As i think we cant get a lot these fields out of the scale system. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51923,CSCI-224,Source-to-Target Mapping,Done,15/Aug/25 4:38 PM

Direct from our Gateway (IP: 192.168.42.65 or 88 – both PowerBI gateway servers)

To MySQL server (172.19.232.11)

Through IP whitelisting/firewall rules

Standard TCP connection on port 3306

 

 

# Best way to connect mainly from data extraction purposes

AE: Above, Analitics team use a MYSQL connector . not sure how they use it. Rachel Foong should be able to provide more info

 

# Is it the live data source or a copy

AE: Copy

 

# If so , refresh frequency

AE: (from attached email)

“We worked with the CloudOps team and confirmed that there is no lag or issue with the Data Save replica database.”

 

# Any Schema Documentation

We don’t have this, maybe check with  Rachel Foong

(see “MAWM – Questions” mail)

 

# Any mapping document between old Scale and New MAWM Data

We don’t have this, maybe check with  Rachel Foong


Next steps: 
what is the best way to connect for ingestion purpose. I think we can explore Azure/Snowflake options and reconnect later.

Not sure what additional details you have added that weren't known 2 weeks ago from Teams and Stand-Up discussions.



You have said ask another person a lot throughout this response also. Can I confirm you are going to own DFIO portion for future analysis to understand where the data currently lives? Where will it live in future? Details etc? CK can help I would say.

For Manhattan Active, we have got those details from CK a few weeks ago. We need to know how many DC’s on it and the roll out plan, core objects to pull etc. If not same as Manhattan Scale.

Adeel responded back on PBI05 Lineage. Jess C has appended to BUS Matrix for sources.

*Jess C to Action:* PBI03 was also a source mentioned in some lineage, can we trace lineage for these back to actual source (PDB19B, PDB08, SQL3 etc). CK email may answer this last part.





*Eugene:* There were some PBI objects that could not be traced back (difficulty in tracing logic therefore decision is made) to actual source therefore decision was made in EDP project to use the PBI object rather then the source db. *Amit and Bhavya should have this background as well*.

Based on those insights, we plan to implement *two pipelines per data source*, particularly for those with high data volumes:

# *Initial Load Pipeline*
This pipeline will handle a one-time bulk load. The DBA team will extract data from the on-premises databases and upload it to Azure Blob Storage as *CSV or Parquet* files. We understand that using Parquet format can help mitigate data quality issues. Once the files are available in Blob Storage, we’ll trigger the pipeline to ingest the data into Snowflake.
# *Incremental Load Pipeline*
This pipeline will manage ongoing data updates by loading incremental changes *directly* from the source databases.

To support this approach, I’ll be setting up an ADF template specifically for extracting data from Parquet files during the initial load phase.

So I believe we need the assistance from Rachel's / DBA team at least in the below:

* Help us validate our current data source mapping is accurate and complete.
* Extract data from the confirmed databases and upload the data to Azure Blob Storage in *Parquet* format. ","27/Jun/25 9:57 AM;639b6a55914b350865d28d1b;Provided a list of source to ingest.

My thought this should be not immediate priority.

Below are some of the analysis and deliverables I think we should include.

But [~accountid:712020:2ff24ce0-2b56-4a71-9d7f-e5cc95f2ccd0] please overlay your thoughts on this, rip what I said apart, add your thoughts on ways to step through the Dimensional Modelling delivery so we can all agree.

Happy for you to come up with thoughts on top of this, remove and add what you like then maybe we have a session next week to confirm how we implement. 



*Business Process Review*

* Business Processes captured in Tactical models vs captured in existing documentation
** Whats included in doc that shouldnt be

*Dimension Review*

* Review Dimensions captured in Tactical models vs captured in existing documentation
** Whats included in doc that shouldnt be

Your points below align to the convo [~accountid:639b6a55914b350865d28d1b] and I had yesterday.

Agree that this task needs to be completed after we have reviewed the business processes/facts first (task [https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-94|https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-94|smart-link]). The dimension review has already been completed ([https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-81|https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-81|smart-link]).

Chloe and I spoke that after the fact review has been complete that I will then go into our Bus Matrix document and update/add any dims and facts that are not currently included.



The data source mapping work I think will need to be its own separate task initially. From what I can see from the current Supply Chain Semantic Models, there are a lot of hops their data source goes through to go from source system to report. Majority of their connections in PBI service are to the *PBI05* server.

Example of some of the lineage:

PBI05 (BI Server) ← PDB08 (AX 2012 Server) ← Azure Blob Storage (for a CSV file load)

Chloe and I are going to look into this further next week to understand what transformations are done between each hop/source 🙂 



I have details of the source connection info that supply chain team are using in PBI service, so once we unpack the lineage from the actual source system, we can join the dots to complete this task.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49782,CSCI-17,Data Transformation Mapping,Done,19/Nov/25 12:30 PM

Currently the Supply Chain team are working to re-map all their existing semantic models to reference only from these above 12 ‘master semantic models' to become as their new source.

There are currently *42 semantic models* in the Operations Analytics workspace in total (excluding their sandbox workspace). These 42 include the above 12, meaning there are currently *30 semantic models* that are created that do not form as part of this ‘master layer’.

The team are in the work-in-progress stage of this migration/re-mapping of their semantic models. For example currently the ‘S&OP Projections’ semantic model only has inputs coming from the ‘master layer’, whereas the ‘SPS KPIs’ semantic model currently has inputs only coming from a DB source (nothing from the master layer).

 

The advice would be:

* Continue to re-map all their current semantic models to this master layer, to reduce the number of queries against the database servers
* Work with the SC team to establish if we can group these models further (eg: can we group ‘DC Inbound Shipments’, ‘DC Outbound Shipments’ and ‘DC Shipment Wave’ as 1 single ‘DC Shipments’ model?)

Currently the Supply Chain team are working to re-map all their existing semantic models to reference only from these above 12 ‘master semantic models' to become as their new source. 

There are currently *42 semantic models* in the Operations Analytics workspace in total (excluding their sandbox workspace). These 42 include the above 12, meaning there are currently *30 semantic models* that are created that do not form as part of this ‘master layer’.

The team are in the work-in-progress stage of this migration/re-mapping of their semantic models. For example currently the ‘S&OP Projections’ semantic model only has inputs coming from the ‘master layer’, whereas the ‘SPS KPIs’ semantic model currently has inputs only coming from a DB source (nothing from the master layer).



The advice would be:

* Continue to re-map all their current semantic models to this master layer, to reduce the number of queries against the database servers
* Work with the SC team to establish if we can group these models further (eg: can we group ‘DC Inbound Shipments’, ‘DC Outbound Shipments’ and ‘DC Shipment Wave’ as 1 single ‘DC Shipments’ model?)","16/Jun/25 12:37 PM;712020:2ff24ce0-2b56-4a71-9d7f-e5cc95f2ccd0;h3. Measures



Currently across the 42 semantic models, we have *692 unique/individual measures*. Some of these can be referencing the same value but expressing this as a different output (eg: *sales* in absolute $'s, *sales* as a %, *sales* last 60 days, etc).

Attached is a list of all measures as of 16.6.25.

We had  the handover meeting and below are the tasks needs to be done 

1. Document Source Systems Models and Reports. Jess is already doing this
2. Is there any similar reports coming from two different source system

# Capture all Flat/Junk Dimensions used in existing reporting
# Capture different kind of Date dimensions used in existing reporting. Like Order Date, Invoiced Date, Shipped Date, Delivery Date etc.
# Grouping of Measures: group all time intelligence KPIs coming from same Measure into one bucket
# Looks for any source system that is not captured in Bus Matrix document
# Look for Data sets ingested from Mobile Dock . These are not captured in documents
# Look for Data Sets captured from MAWM
